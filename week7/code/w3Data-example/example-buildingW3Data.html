       Spotify API response from running the following URL:
        
        https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?query=%22doom+metal%22&offset=0&limit=5&type=playlist
        
        This is a playlist search of "doom metal" and only returning 5 
        search results
        
        the results are stored in the following javascript file to make
        this example more readable. If you open the file you will see that is just a variable called, serverData, that contains the javascript response.

       <h1> Parsing Data Demo</h1>
       <p> Things were a little thick in class last session. That is to be expected given that there are a lot of moving parts in building even a simple app like this. However, I know you can get it and I can do a better job of breaking down the pieces that go into working with an API like this.</p>

       <p> This is a demo that I whipped together. In order to properly use it you must read the page source. Find the first script tag at the bottom of the HTML source file.</p>

       <p>
        The code is <span class="w3-yellow">heavily</span> commented and it describes each step in the process.  The HTML file output will show you the results of the code executing. </p>

       <p>Read through this and try to understand what is happening. Change values and see if you can predict the results before you reload the page. One hint is to open the console which will alert you if you have made any coding errors.</p>
