					<p style="font-family:Avenir Next Condensed">It's pretty unclear whether or not the 
					butterfly was a symbol of who I am or who I am supposed to aspire to be. The description 
					for the butterfly spent a lot of effort in advising ways to look upon the butterfly to 
					be a better person, love myself, and essentially chill the hell out. The advice was 
					pretty terrible. The butterfly is a representation of "metamorphosis and transformation 
					in my personal life" as well as moving through different life cycles. I think in obvious
					terms, this acceptance of transformation resonates well with the ending of my undergraduate 
				 career and the beginning of my professional life, but the changes in my personal life aren't
				  as drastic as this butterfly is making it out to be. I used to deal with anxiety and 
				  stress about the uncertainty of my life and where I was going to be in 5, 10 years. Sometime
				   over the course of the last year, largely due to my travels and adventures in South Africa 
				   and Namibia, I gained a sense of peace and contentment with my life that I've managed to 
				   keep with me every day since. I think my psyche and I are pretty cool as it is. On the
				    other hand, I can appreciate the lighthearted and playfulness that the butterfly also 
				    represents (although I've never seen a butterfly that wanted to make friends or chill 
				    out for a minute or two, so there's that.)    </br>
