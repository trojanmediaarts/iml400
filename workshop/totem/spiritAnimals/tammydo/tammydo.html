    My SpiritAnimal quiz results described me as an animal of deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge.
    </p>

    I think I am connected with myself. My therapist says: "...Tammu...You have had an inner dialogue with yourself for awhile...continue to tap into your center."</p>
    
    <p>
    I nod and say yes. I did the same thing when I got these results...Nod and say yes. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Honestly I think the (any) results are worded vaguely enough that anyone could connect with them. Emotional Resonance is a product of this kind of online quiz memetic engineering? Can we talk about the reading? That was interesting.

    I am taking this class, because I want to solidify my coding skills, and develop something creative and fun.
